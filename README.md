# Bachelorarbeit Baran Demir 2023

This repository contains my Bachelor's Thesis written in the year 2023 and accompanying sources. In summary the thesis analyzes how Deep Reinforcement Learning can be used to make a quadruped robot learn movements in simulation, as well as how these movements can be joint together to produce a single coherent motion. These principles were implemented and evaluated in NVIDIA's simulation tool Isaac Sim. Below are the results as videos.
